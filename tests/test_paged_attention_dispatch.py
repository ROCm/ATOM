"""Envelopes of the two paged decode kernels.

Launch policy only -- `gluon_decode_over_limit` is integer arithmetic and needs
no device. It still needs triton and aiter to be importable, because it lives
beside the kernel wrappers it describes and `atom.model_ops.base_attention`
pulls both at import. The CPU CI runner installs neither (`pre-checks.yaml`
installs cpu torch and pytest), so this file self-skips there, the same way
every other attention test in this directory does. Its coverage comes from a
GPU environment.

What is worth asserting here is the coupling to aiter, since nothing else
watches it: the gluon kernel picks its register layout from a table keyed on
next_pow2(query_group_size), and past the last arm the variable is simply never
bound -- a Triton compile error with nothing in it about speculative length.
